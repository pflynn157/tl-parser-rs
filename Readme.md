## Tiny Lang Parser RS

This is a parser for Tiny Lang written in Rust. Currently, it's just a frontend, and a limited one at that. It can parse the entire language, but the syntax, type, and semantic checkings are currently limited. However, it is ready to go to create a complete compiler.

The main purpose of this project was to experiment with compiler development in Rust (and to provide a case-in-point that TinyLang is indeed suitable for experiments like this).
